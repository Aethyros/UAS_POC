# Intelligent Counter-UAS Prototype (UASPOC)

> **Simulation Notice:** This repository contains a software-based Proof of Concept (PoC) simulator developed for internal airspace defense research. All capabilities — including multi-modal sensor ingestion, RF signal intelligence, AI classification, trajectory tracking, threat assessment, and cyber takeover execution — are purely mathematical simulations. This software does not perform real-world RF interception, physical transmission, or live UAV engagement.

## Overview

This platform provides an integrated, real-time software simulation pipeline for validating multi-modal UAV threat detection, AI-driven classification, continuous spatial tracking, and non-kinetic countermeasure execution. It is designed as a modular, production-grade proof of concept to accelerate research and development of next-generation counter-UAS systems.

## Problem Statement

The proliferation of commercially available UAVs has significantly outpaced the development of effective detection and neutralization technologies. While drones offer substantial utility, their growing accessibility introduces serious security risks in contested airspaces and critical infrastructure zones. This PoC aims to simulate the "Decision Support" layer that bridges physical SDR hardware and multi-sensor fusion suites.

## Key Architectural Features

Our RF Intelligence module has been deeply optimized for real-time visualization and accurate DSP (Digital Signal Processing):

- **Unified DSP Execution** — Time-domain waveforms and frequency-domain FFT spectrograms are generated in a single pass. This ensures 100% mathematical synchronization between what you see on the oscilloscope and the spectrum analyzer.
- **High-Performance FHSS Synthesis** — Evasive military Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) signals are generated using vectorized, pre-allocated single-precision (float32) arrays, reducing memory overhead and CPU latency by >70%.
- **UI Decimation** — The backend dynamically downsamples large arrays (e.g., 64,000+ points down to 2,048) right before JSON serialization. This cuts network transfer times by 90% and ensures the browser UI never freezes.
- **Telemetry-Aware Generation** — The physical duration of RF bursts (Time-on-Air) is dynamically calculated using database ground-truth values (`packet_length` and `symbol_rate`).

## Repository Structure

Our team operates on a strict parallel-development matrix. Each developer is exclusively assigned to their designated subdirectory under `src/`. **Do not modify files outside your assigned module.**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL (running locally with seeded drone signatures)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Aethyros/UAS_POC.git
cd UASPOC

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Server

Start the core FastAPI backend so downstream modules can consume the data:

```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

## Using the Intelligence HUD (Visualizer)

The `visualizer.py` script acts as a tactical Heads-Up Display (HUD) to verify backend signals. It queries the local API and renders a synchronized Oscilloscope and FFT Spectrum Analyzer.

Ensure your backend server is running, then open a second terminal:

**1. Simulate a Standard Civilian Drone (Fixed-Frequency)**

```bash
python src/rf_intelligence/visualizer.py
```

**2. Simulate a Military/Evasive Threat (FHSS Hopping)**

Triggers the HUD's master warning overlay and visualizes dynamic frequency hopping based on database telemetry:

```bash
python src/rf_intelligence/visualizer.py
```

## API Reference

The RF Module exposes standardized API contracts for cross-team integration.
